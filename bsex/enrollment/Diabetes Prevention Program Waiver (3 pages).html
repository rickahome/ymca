            <h3>YMCA’S DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM CONSENT AND RELEASE FROM LIABILITY</h3>
			<p>I hereby consent to voluntarily participate in the YMCA’s Diabetes Prevention Program with The West Cook YMCA. I understand the goal of the program is to help adults at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles by eating healthier, increasing physical activity, and losing a modest amount of weight to reduce their chances of developing the disease.</p>
			<p>I understand the YMCA does not practice medicine and the YMCA’s Diabetes Prevention Program is not a substitute for the care I receive from my physician or other qualified health care providers. I understand the YMCA’s Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Coach is not a qualified health care professional, does not practice medicine, and that support provided by the Lifestyle Coach is not a substitute for the care I receive from my physician or other qualified health care providers.</p>
			<p>In consideration for being allowed to participate in this program, I agree to assume the risk of such activity, and further agree to hold harmless the YMCA, its employees and agents, from any and all claims, suits, losses or related causes of action for damages, including, but not limited to, such claims that may result in my injury or death, accidental or otherwise, during or arising in any way from my participation in the YMCA’s Diabetes Prevention Program.</p>
			<p>By signing below, I affirm that I have read the above in its entirety and I understand the nature of the YMCA’s Diabetes Prevention Program. I also affirm that my questions regarding the program have been answered to my satisfaction.</p>
